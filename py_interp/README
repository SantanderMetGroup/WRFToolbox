py_interp is a version of p_interp written in python. It uses the f2py interface
to call fortran subroutines extracted from the original p_interp. These are located
in  py_interp_fortran.F90 inside a module call "routines". To make it a python module
type:

f2py -c py_interp_fortran.F90 -m py_interp_fortran

Check http://pybonacci.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/integrar-fortran-con-python-usando-f2py/
for a tutorial.

Once compiled, it can be imported into python as a regular python package.

from py_interp_fortran import routines as f90

Usage: type python py_interp.py -h for help.

Now it is possible to make py_interp to be a standalone execulable, though it is heavy (14M), using pyinstaller. Use make_executable.sh to build it.
